# Event Management API

## Introduction

This project is an API built using Laravel 10, designed to manage event creation, registration of attendees, and authentication. The API supports user login and logout using Laravel Sanctum for authentication, CRUD operations for events and attendees, and sending reminder notifications for upcoming events. It also leverages Laravel's Queue system for background processing and the Scheduler for automating tasks like sending reminders.

4. **Send Event Reminders**
    - **Send Event Reminders**: Automatically scheduled via a command `app:send-event-reminders`, which sends reminders to attendees of upcoming events.

## Technologies

- **Laravel 10**: PHP framework used for building the API.
- **MariaDB**: Database for managing data.
- **Laravel Sanctum**: Used for API authentication and token management.
- **Notifications**: Laravelâ€™s notification system used for sending event reminders.

## Database Design and Structure

- **Users**: Stores user credentials and details.
- **Events**: Stores event information such as name, description, start and end times.
- **Attendees**: Links users to events as attendees.

### Main Models:
1. **User**
    - Attributes: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

2. **Event**
    - Attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
    - Relations:
        - `user`: The creator of the event.
        - `attendees`: Users attending the event.

3. **Attendee**
    - Attributes: `id`, `user_id`, `event_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
    - Relations:
        - `user`: The user attending the event.
        - `event`: The event the attendee is registered for.

## Queues and Scheduled Tasks

This application leverages Laravel's **Queue** and **Scheduler** to handle background processing and periodic tasks.

### Queue Usage
- **Event Reminders**: Notifications to event attendees are dispatched to the queue for asynchronous processing, ensuring that the main application flow is not delayed by sending emails.
- **Queue Driver**: The queue system can be configured with drivers like `database`, `redis`, etc. Ensure your `.env` is properly set up to enable queue functionality.

### Scheduled Tasks
- **Daily Event Reminders**: The API uses Laravel's task scheduling feature to automate sending reminders.
    - The command `app:send-event-reminders` is scheduled to run daily:
      ```php
      protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void
      {
          $schedule->command('app:send-event-reminders')->daily();
      }
      ```
    - This command retrieves all events starting in the next 24 hours and sends reminder notifications to registered attendees.

To enable scheduling, you need to set up a cron job on your server to call the Laravel scheduler every minute:
```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
## Installation

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```
10. Set up a cron job to run the Laravel scheduler every minute (on your server):
```bash
